HashWars is a fast-paced, multiplayer Web3 shooter game built on Hedera Hashgraph. Players compete in real-time battles where the results, leaderboards, and rewards are stored on the Hedera blockchain for fairness and transparency. Using HTS tokens (e.g., $HASH), players earn rewards and trade in-game assets like NFTs (skins, weapons). The game leverages Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to ensure match integrity and immutable records, making every victory secure and verifiable on the blockchain.
